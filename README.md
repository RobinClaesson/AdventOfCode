# AdventOfCode
My solutions for the puzzles in adventofcode.com

Some, if not most, of the solutions are old and porly optimized. Many are old solutions from early coding days that I had laying around updated just to use my AoC functions.


#AoC Library
The folder AoC contains a library of classes that all of my solutions uses. They are mostly for importing and outputing input and output data, but some are functions that i saw my self use in several solitions and did'nt want to reuse.
